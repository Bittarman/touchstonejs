Touchstone
==========

Mobile App Framework powered by React.

Currently under development, docs will be available soon at [touchstonejs.io](http://www.touchstonejs.io).

**Note:** The `master` branch is currently mid-refactor as we bring across some major improvements for the new version, and is not yet stable. If you are looking for a stable version, please check out the `0.3.x` branch.

Follow [@touchstonejs](https://twitter.com/touchstonejs) on Twitter for updates.

See the [touchstone-starter](https://github.com/Thinkmill/touchstone-starter) project for example usage.

An online demo is available at [demo.touchstonejs.io](http://demo.touchstonejs.io).
